# CrossLingua-UrduTrans  
*A Neural Machine Translation System for English ↔ Urdu*

This repository demonstrates a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** system for translating between **English and Urdu** using **Hugging Face Transformers**.  
The project highlights the challenges and solutions in building translation systems for **low-resource languages**, directly connecting to research in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Cross-Lingual Deep Learning**.

## 🌍 Research Motivation

While high-resource languages like English, Japanese, and Chinese have abundant datasets for machine translation, **Urdu is a low-resource language** with limited parallel corpora.  
This project explores the potential of **cross-lingual NMT** by adapting pre-trained deep learning models for **English ↔ Urdu translation**, focusing on:

- 🌐 **Multilingual NLP** for low-resource languages  
- 🧠 **Semantic representation and compositionality**  
- 📑 **Knowledge acquisition** from bilingual text corpora  
- 🔄 **Machine translation leveraging deep learning**  

These directions align closely with the research areas of leading NLP laboratories such as **NAIST’s NLP Lab**.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Translation between **English and Urdu**  
- ✅ Built on **Transformer-based MarianMT models**  
- ✅ Simple scripts and Jupyter notebooks for inference  
- ✅ Easily extendable to other low-resource language pairs
