# EngUrdu_NMT  
*A Neural Machine Translation System for English ↔ Urdu*  

This repository presents a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** system for translating between **English and Urdu**, built with **Hugging Face Transformers**.  
The project emphasizes the importance of addressing **low-resource languages** in NLP research and demonstrates how **pre-trained deep learning models** can be adapted for **cross-lingual translation** tasks.  

---

## 🌍 Research Motivation  

Most machine translation systems are designed for **high-resource languages** (e.g., English, Japanese, Chinese) where large datasets are readily available.  
In contrast, **Urdu is a low-resource language** with limited bilingual corpora, making accurate translation more challenging.  

This project explores solutions to these challenges by focusing on:  
- 🌐 **Multilingual NLP** for underrepresented languages  
- 🧠 **Semantic representation and compositionality** in translation  
- 📑 **Knowledge extraction** from bilingual text corpora  
- 🔄 **Machine translation enhanced by deep learning**

## ⚙️ Key Features  

- ✅ Translate between **English and Urdu**  
- ✅ Based on **Transformer-based MarianMT models**  
- ✅ Includes **ready-to-use Jupyter notebook** for quick testing  
- ✅ Lightweight and extendable to other **low-resource language pairs**
